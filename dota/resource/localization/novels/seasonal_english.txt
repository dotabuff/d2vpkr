	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-01-shoulder_Quartero_4"		"Even a modest ten percent gratuity would trigger a sharp pain deep inside my bones. What do you call it... the marrow, I think?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-01-shoulder_Quartero_5"		"Yes, the marrow part would turn into boiling worms or something. It's happened several times, and let me assure you, it stings like you would not :hero_faceless_void::hero_undying::hero_crystal_maiden::hero_kunkka:ing believe."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-01-shoulder_Quartero_6"		"And therein lies my tragic yet riveting backstory."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-01-shoulder_Quartero_7"		"Don't worry, here it comes."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-01-weapon_Quartero_1"		"Oh, that looks fantastic on you! I insist you abscond with the entire set."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-01-weapon_Quartero_2"		"And as mentioned, put your money away. I will not —  CAN not — take a single solitary cent."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-01-weapon_Quartero_3"		"As for that tale of woe I promised you, it's a doozy. A painful and frankly embarrassing memory for yours truly."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-02-shoulder_Quartero_2"		"Where was I? Ah, my tragic backstory, yes. Brace yourself for pathos, this one's going to pluck at the heart strings a bit."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-02-legs_Quartero_4"		"^-1.0Castles, caves, dungeons! There was no quest that was too much for us! No obstacle that–"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-02-legs_Quartero_5"		"^-2.0Well, I can see your eyes starting to wander, so let's cut to the chase: obviously there WAS a quest that was too much for us, so let's spill the tea and get to it."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-02-head_Quartero_0"		"Let's get this Morrigan's Measure on you. These are real Ostrivian swamp ostrich feathers, by the way. Or maybe it's Pellivian skybeaver. It's extinct, anyway."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-02-head_Quartero_1"		"Wandering back to my tragic tale. From the very start, nothing went right."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-02-head_Quartero_2"		"Behind every door, skeletons. Behind every secret passage, skeletons. Inside every treasure chest, skeletons."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-02-head_Quartero_3"		"There should obviously be SOME skeletons, it was a dungeon, after all, but the skeleton-to-square-foot ratio here was absurd."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-02-head_Quartero_4"		"Then half of the party melted into the unknowable shadows."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-02-head_Quartero_5"		"^-1.0And of course there were skeletons there too, so we heard a lot of screaming from the unknowable shadows."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-02-head_Quartero_6"		"More skeletons arrived, obviously. Everything went absolutely :hero_faceless_void::hero_abyssal_underlord::hero_chaos_knight::hero_kez:ing pear-shaped."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-02-weapon_Quartero_1"		"Watch out, it's sharp. Also glowing. I wouldn't let the glowy parts touch your skin if I were you, pick it up by the hilt. There you go."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-02-weapon_Quartero_2"		"Now, here's the wrinkle: Could I have brought them all back to full health with my bag of priceless tonics? Or given them a first-rate weapon, like that glowy number you're swinging around right now?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-02-weapon_Quartero_3"		"Technically, yes. And more technically, they asked."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-02-weapon_Quartero_4"		"Can I be blunt? They weren't going to make it. There's a dungeon crawl, and then there's just crawling through a dungeon."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-02-weapon_Quartero_5"		"So, to spare you the saga, yours truly wisely decided..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-02-weapon_Quartero_6"		"...to hoard the supplies."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-arms_Quartero_1"		"Yes, it's free and yes, you can have it."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-arms_Quartero_2"		"But the Drakon's Deed is the jewel of my collection, so I hope you appreciate it."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-arms_Quartero_3"		"I'd never part with something this valuable if I wasn't being forced to at curse-point."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-arms_Quartero_4"		"I'm spoiling my own tragic backstory. Let me hurry this along before I give away any more twists."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-arms_Quartero_5"		"By the end, it was just me. And the boss monster of the dungeon. One of those vast incomprehensible eldritch horror things, you know the type."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-arms_Quartero_6"		"Mouths where eyes should be and vice versa. I certainly wasn't going to fight the :hero_faceless_void::hero_ursa::hero_clinkz::hero_kunkka:ing thing."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-arms_Quartero_7"		"I was just heading for the door when... it stopped me."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-arms_Quartero_8"		"And GLOWERED at me with a thousand glowering eyeballs."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-head_Quartero_2"		"^-2.0Anyway: boss monster, stopped me, glowering, eyeballs. I don't mind telling you, for an ancient eldritchian horror, he had some VERY strong words for yours truly about my approach to teamwork."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-head_Quartero_3"		"He seemed to think I was some kind of greedy coward."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-head_Quartero_4"		"^-1.0He had me all wrong, of course, but he also had me wrapped up in his filthy tentacles at the bottom of his cave, so what was I supposed to do? At any rate, he CURSED me."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-head_Quartero_5"		"Well, he insisted it wasn't a curse. More of a moral rebuke."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-legs_Quartero_0"		"To cut a tragic tale short: Because of what he deemed my appalling greed and cowardice, I would never be able to keep anything valuable again."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-legs_Quartero_1"		"I am sentenced — doomed, really — to spend my life handing over all my best stuff — and I'm talking the really good shit here — to heroes like yourself."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-legs_Quartero_2"		"Speaking of which, those knee plates are solid gold, so don't actually take a knee in them or you'll scuff the finish."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-legs_Quartero_3"		"Hm. Yes, I hear the squeaking too. I'd just walk around in them a bit, you'll need to work the leather in."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-shoulders__title_0"		"Drakon's Deed Pauldrons"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-shoulders_Quartero_0"		"These pauldrons are solid bronze, by the way. If I had to guess, they couldn't weigh an ounce less than two hundred pounds."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-shoulders_Quartero_1"		"Not a problem for a strapping hero like yourself, of course."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-shoulders_Quartero_2"		"But if you DO start to feel a crippling pain in the shoulders, I think it's a safe guess it's the pauldrons. Bring them back in, we can hollow some of that bronze out."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-shoulders_Quartero_3"		"Where was I? Right. Cursed forevermore by a protoplasmic horror to give away all my stuff."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-shoulders_Quartero_4"		"And the worst part? Just so there's no mistaking any of this gift-giving for actual generosity..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-shoulders_Quartero_5"		"I am ALSO condemned to explain the awkward origin of my predicament to anyone who asks."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-shoulders_Quartero_6"		"Plus anyone who doesn't ask."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-back_Quartero_3"		"Heartbreaking stuff. For me, obviously."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-back_Quartero_4"		"You're making out like a bandit here. If a watchman spotted any of this he'd accuse you of highway robbery."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-back_Quartero_5"		"Speaking of which, how does that backpiece fit? That's real bronze, like the shoulders. Five hundred pounds, I'd bet. But you'll barely even feel the weight once you get moving in it."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-back_Quartero_6"		"Though I'd move around mostly in the shade if I were you, that bronze is going to get hot in the sun."
