	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-01-shoulder_Quartero_4"		"Even a modest ten percent gratuity would trigger a sharp pain deep inside my bones. What do you call it... the marrow, I think?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-01-shoulder_Quartero_5"		"Yes, the marrow part would turn into boiling worms or something. It's happened several times, and let me assure you, it stings like you would not :hero_faceless_void::hero_undying::hero_crystal_maiden::hero_kunkka:ing believe."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-01-shoulder_Quartero_6"		"And therein lies my tragic yet riveting backstory."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-01-shoulder_Quartero_7"		"Don't worry, here it comes."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-01-weapon_Quartero_1"		"Oh, that looks fantastic on you! I insist you abscond with the entire set."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-01-weapon_Quartero_2"		"And as mentioned, put your money away. I will not —  CAN not — take a single solitary cent."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-01-weapon_Quartero_3"		"As for that tale of woe I promised you, it's a doozy. A painful and frankly embarrassing memory for yours truly."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-02-shoulder_Quartero_2"		"Where was I? Ah, my tragic backstory, yes. Brace yourself for pathos, this one's going to pluck at the heart strings a bit."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-02-legs_Quartero_4"		"^-1.0Castles, caves, dungeons! There was no quest that was too much for us! No obstacle that–"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-02-legs_Quartero_5"		"^-2.0Well, I can see your eyes starting to wander, so let's cut to the chase: obviously there WAS a quest that was too much for us, so let's spill the tea and get to it."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-02-head_Quartero_0"		"Let's get this Morrigan's Measure on you. These are real Ostrivian swamp ostrich feathers, by the way. Or maybe it's Pellivian skybeaver. It's extinct, anyway."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-02-head_Quartero_1"		"Wandering back to my tragic tale. From the very start, nothing went right."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-02-head_Quartero_2"		"Behind every door, skeletons. Behind every secret passage, skeletons. Inside every treasure chest, skeletons."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-02-head_Quartero_3"		"There should obviously be SOME skeletons, it was a dungeon, after all, but the skeleton-to-square-foot ratio here was absurd."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-02-head_Quartero_4"		"Then half of the party melted into the unknowable shadows."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-02-head_Quartero_5"		"^-1.0And of course there were skeletons there too, so we heard a lot of screaming from the unknowable shadows."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-02-head_Quartero_6"		"More skeletons arrived, obviously. Everything went absolutely :hero_faceless_void::hero_abyssal_underlord::hero_chaos_knight::hero_kez:ing pear-shaped."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-02-weapon_Quartero_1"		"Watch out, it's sharp. Also glowing. I wouldn't let the glowy parts touch your skin if I were you, pick it up by the hilt. There you go."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-02-weapon_Quartero_2"		"Now, here's the wrinkle: Could I have brought them all back to full health with my bag of priceless tonics? Or given them a first-rate weapon, like that glowy number you're swinging around right now?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-02-weapon_Quartero_3"		"Technically, yes. And more technically, they asked."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-02-weapon_Quartero_4"		"Can I be blunt? They weren't going to make it. There's a dungeon crawl, and then there's just crawling through a dungeon."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-02-weapon_Quartero_5"		"So, to spare you the saga, yours truly wisely decided..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-02-weapon_Quartero_6"		"...to hoard the supplies."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-arms_Quartero_1"		"Yes, it's free and yes, you can have it."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-arms_Quartero_2"		"But the Drakon's Deed is the jewel of my collection, so I hope you appreciate it."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-arms_Quartero_3"		"I'd never part with something this valuable if I wasn't being forced to at curse-point."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-arms_Quartero_4"		"I'm spoiling my own tragic backstory. Let me hurry this along before I give away any more twists."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-arms_Quartero_5"		"By the end, it was just me. And the boss monster of the dungeon. One of those vast incomprehensible eldritch horror things, you know the type."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-arms_Quartero_6"		"Mouths where eyes should be and vice versa. I certainly wasn't going to fight the :hero_faceless_void::hero_ursa::hero_clinkz::hero_kunkka:ing thing."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-arms_Quartero_7"		"I was just heading for the door when... it stopped me."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-arms_Quartero_8"		"And GLOWERED at me with a thousand glowering eyeballs."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-head_Quartero_2"		"^-2.0Anyway: boss monster, stopped me, glowering, eyeballs. I don't mind telling you, for an ancient eldritchian horror, he had some VERY strong words for yours truly about my approach to teamwork."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-head_Quartero_3"		"He seemed to think I was some kind of greedy coward."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-head_Quartero_4"		"^-1.0He had me all wrong, of course, but he also had me wrapped up in his filthy tentacles at the bottom of his cave, so what was I supposed to do? At any rate, he CURSED me."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-head_Quartero_5"		"Well, he insisted it wasn't a curse. More of a moral rebuke."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-legs_Quartero_0"		"To cut a tragic tale short: Because of what he deemed my appalling greed and cowardice, I would never be able to keep anything valuable again."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-legs_Quartero_1"		"I am sentenced — doomed, really — to spend my life handing over all my best stuff — and I'm talking the really good shit here — to heroes like yourself."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-legs_Quartero_2"		"Speaking of which, those knee plates are solid gold, so don't actually take a knee in them or you'll scuff the finish."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-legs_Quartero_3"		"Hm. Yes, I hear the squeaking too. I'd just walk around in them a bit, you'll need to work the leather in."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-shoulders__title_0"		"Drakon's Deed Pauldrons"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-shoulders_Quartero_0"		"These pauldrons are solid bronze, by the way. If I had to guess, they couldn't weigh an ounce less than two hundred pounds."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-shoulders_Quartero_1"		"Not a problem for a strapping hero like yourself, of course."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-shoulders_Quartero_2"		"But if you DO start to feel a crippling pain in the shoulders, I think it's a safe guess it's the pauldrons. Bring them back in, we can hollow some of that bronze out."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-shoulders_Quartero_3"		"Where was I? Right. Cursed forevermore by a protoplasmic horror to give away all my stuff."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-shoulders_Quartero_4"		"And the worst part? Just so there's no mistaking any of this gift-giving for actual generosity..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-shoulders_Quartero_5"		"I am ALSO condemned to explain the awkward origin of my predicament to anyone who asks."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-shoulders_Quartero_6"		"Plus anyone who doesn't ask."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-back_Quartero_3"		"Heartbreaking stuff. For me, obviously."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-back_Quartero_4"		"You're making out like a bandit here. If a watchman spotted any of this he'd accuse you of highway robbery."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-back_Quartero_5"		"Speaking of which, how does that backpiece fit? That's real bronze, like the shoulders. Five hundred pounds, I'd bet. But you'll barely even feel the weight once you get moving in it."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_fall_2025_Dialogue_itemset-03-back_Quartero_6"		"Though I'd move around mostly in the shade if I were you, that bronze is going to get hot in the sun."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set01_itm04_Quartero_3"		"So. Mystery solved, but also who cares, because the POINT is it turned out he had an ARMOR HOARD."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set01_itm04_Quartero_4"		"This king loved armor. A LOT. He'd spent every coin in the realm on ruinously expensive item sets. And now, thanks to the witch's curse, he couldn't wear ANY of them."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set01_itm05_Quartero_1"		"Anyway, he said I could have the whole set, and he'd even throw in the wands, and all I had to do was go on a quest to the Fountain of Babrasba and find him a magic elixir. Sounded easy enough..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set01_itm05_Quartero_2"		"...and then he got out the map."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set01_itm06_Quartero_1"		"Not easy to smuggle these out of the Burrowed Kingdoms anymore, either. Not since— Well, that's another story."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set01_itm06_Quartero_3"		"That was the plan, anyway. As it happened, she wouldn't let me in her cottage."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set01_itm06_Quartero_5"		"Hmm. Let me be careful here. I... went... BACK to the village, and bought several rounds of ale at the tavern for the many witnesses present."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set01_itm06_Quartero_6"		"Yes. And WHILE I was there... you won't believe this... somebody burned her house down."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set01_itm06_Quartero_7"		"Lifted the curse instantly."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set02_itm01_Quartero_3"		"You look REALLY evil, by the way. I can't tell what face you're making under there, but from here you look terrifying."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set02_itm01_Quartero_4"		"Also, legally, I feel like I should be very very clear about that last part I told you about the witch's house burning down while I was somewhere else with countless witnesses present."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set02_itm01_Quartero_6"		"No, I think she lifted the curse, moved to a different town and changed her name."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set02_itm01_Quartero_7"		"In fact that's almost certainly what happened. In fact that's what I told the constables."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set02_itm02_Quartero_0"		"Anyway, I went back to the king and he was a human again! Also dead."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set02_itm02_Quartero_1"		"I guess what happened was, he must've run straight to his armory and started trying on all his precious armor, and I guess the witch came BACK to life briefly before dying again, because he suddenly turned back into a spider, then back into a human."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set02_itm02_Quartero_2"		"And if you suddenly go from a PERSON-shaped body into a SPIDER body, and then back into a PERSON body, while you're still inside steel armor... Well, I'll spare you the details."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set02_itm02_Quartero_3"		"He died instantly."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set02_itm02_Quartero_5"		"And, honestly, it took a surprisingly long time. A few minutes at least."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set02_itm02_Quartero_6"		"Oh. Also, earlier... Did I say the witch came BACK from the DEAD? (Nervous chuckle) What I obviously meant... was... you look fantastic in those Molten Maulers."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set02_itm03__title_0"		"Molten Mantle"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set02_itm03_Quartero_0"		"At any rate, I can report that, unlike the witch, happily retired somewhere, I imagine, the king was dead."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set02_itm03_Quartero_1"		"I was able to pry most of him out of this Molten Mantle here, let's get it on you, hm?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set02_itm03_Quartero_2"		"Nffh! There! Snug as a button."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set02_itm03_Quartero_3"		"There might still be a few chunks slopping around in there, you can keep those if you find any, the villagers and I found enough of him to bury."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set02_itm03_Quartero_4"		"The point is, technically the king was 100% curse-free by the end, and a deal's a deal."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set02_itm03_Quartero_5"		"So yours truly helped himself, as agreed, to any one item set of my choosing."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set02_itm03_Quartero_6"		"Naturally I chose the Nether Beetle set. But then I also liked the look of the Molten Monarch set, so I figured, why not take BOTH for now so you could try them on, and I'd return whichever one you didn't like?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set02_itm03_Quartero_7"		"And THAT gave me another idea, which is why not steal EVERYTHING, and I was just smashing a third set out of its glass case when some guards showed up."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set02_itm03_Quartero_8"		"Now, I'll bet you're wondering. I said at the beginning that this story had a HAPPY ending. Yet here we are at the end of the tale and the entire cast is dead or missing."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm01_Quartero_1"		"I know it looks like it's on fire. That is because it is on fire."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm01_Quartero_2"		"But most of the heat radiates outward, so once you've got it on that should be the worst of the burns."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm01_Quartero_3"		"Funny story behind this item set. I actually obtained it while trying to get my hands on a different set at Ultimyr University."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm01_Quartero_4"		"I'd tried sneaking my way into the university disguised as a professor. \"Welcome to class! You there! Read that book! Good!\" and so on."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm01_Quartero_5"		"I hadn't counted on a Gem of True Sight, which was judging every heart in the room for so much as a flicker of ill intent."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm02_Quartero_0"		"Let's get this armor on you."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm02_Quartero_1"		"Nffh! That is heavy."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm02_Quartero_2"		"You must be roasting like a duck in there.  Well, If it gets too hot just wave."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm02_Quartero_3"		"Anyway, prison. I didn't care for it."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm02_Quartero_4"		"I didn't like the cell. I didn't like the rats, or the bed, or the toilet next to the bed."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm02_Quartero_5"		"But mostly I didn't like Dodrick. He was the jailer."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm02_Quartero_6"		"I mean, I get it, it's prison, Quartero's not made of marshmallow jam. But, I mean... a simple BLANKET to keep me warm at night."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm02_Quartero_7"		"I had one, yes, but two would have been even snugglier, and there was a whole pile of them in the linen closet."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm02_Quartero_8"		"Or the food, hero. A bowl of gruel is literally water and gristle. It would have cost the prison essentially nothing to adopt a bottomless bowl policy."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm02_Quartero_9"		"It was like Dodrick was going out of his way to make prison as unpleasant as possible."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm03_Quartero_1"		"You know, it's odd, when I look directly at the sigil... It's like it fills my heart with... "

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm03_Quartero_3"		"Ah! Despair. That's it. Looking at it fills me with despair."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm03_Quartero_4"		"Tell you what, I'm going to stop."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm03_Quartero_5"		"Anyway, there I was, rotting away in the dungeon, lying on my filthy mattress next to my filthy toilet, when there, on the filthy wall, I spotted it."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm03_Quartero_6"		"A summoning spell! I could summon a GENIE!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm03_Quartero_7"		"I could wish that Dodrick would fall into his gruel cauldron and drown!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm03_Quartero_8"		"And that his death spasms knocked over the pile of spare blankets and they all rolled into my cell!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm03_Quartero_9"		"Also I could have just wished to not be in PRISON, obviously, but I was still VERY cross with Dodrick at the time and, well, not thinking straight."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm03_Quartero_10"		"I fudged some of the syllables here and there, but basically got the spell right, and presto!"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm04_Quartero_0"		"Let me cinch the belt for you. There! Give the warkilt a twirl."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm04_Quartero_1"		"Yes! Very nice twirling."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm04_Quartero_2"		"Next time wear something under the warkilt, that was... a LOT for your old pal Quartero."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm04_Quartero_3"		"Where was I in my gripping prison narrative? Right! The breakout! I'd summoned a wish-granting genie!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm04_Quartero_4"		"Genie! I commanded, \"Heed my first wish!\""
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm04_Quartero_5"		"Well, it turns out I didn't say every single little tiny syllable in the spell perfect."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm04_Quartero_6"		"Because I hadn't summoned a wish-granting genie after all, but a much rarer people-murdering genie."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm04_Quartero_7"		"I asked if he'd let me make a wish anyway as long as it didn't involve him not murdering someone, and he said no."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm04_Quartero_8"		"In fact, ALL he wanted to know was which insolent fool had summoned him, because he said he was going to..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm04_Quartero_9"		"And I quote, \"pound out their skeleton and wear their skin like a jacket.\""
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm04_Quartero_10"		"So I said, \"It was him.\""
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm04_Quartero_11"		"And I pointed at Dodrick."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm05__title_0"		"Magma Fang"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm05_Quartero_0"		"I saved the best for last: the Magma Fang!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm05_Quartero_1"		"So the best part about this weapon... other than it's a glowing axe the size of a horse, is... look closely. "
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm05_Quartero_2"		"It's not even forged! It's just a massive shard of lava rock!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm05_Quartero_3"		"And let me tell you, it cuts through prison bars like a hot knife through a surprised jailer."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm05_Quartero_4"		"The murder genie melted the bars, grabbed Dodrick by the ankles, and smashed him against a wall until his skeleton came out."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm05_Quartero_5"		"Now, technically my cell didn't have bars blocking the way out anymore. But it DID have a giant murder-genie in ember armor."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm05_Quartero_6"		"And he'd just run out of people to murder, so I was hoping... he wouldn't... notice..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm05_Quartero_7"		"...He noticed me."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm05_Quartero_8"		"So. I had a murder-genie stomping towards me holding that Magma Fang, wearing poor stupid Dodrick as a jacket. My back was against the wall. "
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm05_Quartero_9"		"What could I do? I said the summoning spell again."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set03_itm05_Quartero_10"		"Now I had TWO murder-genies in the room with me."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm01__title_0"		"Golden Mane"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm01_Quartero_0"		"Ah, the Gilded Tyrant! Volcanically gilded with mercury, I believe."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm01_Quartero_1"		"Unbelievably toxic, of course, but it's not like you're going to put it in your mouth or anything..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm01_Quartero_2"		"Or on your skin or near your face... So! There I was. "
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm01_Quartero_3"		"I'd said the summoning spell AGAIN, and what must have been the first murder-genie's SUPERVISOR showed up, because he was wearing the same armor as the FIRST guy... except it looked a lot more expensive."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm01_Quartero_4"		"He was also just as angry as the first guy. \"What insolent fool summoned me, I will pound out their skeleton,\" all the same stuff. "
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm01_Quartero_5"		"And I figured, well, it worked once, so I point at the first genie and I say: \"HE summoned you. Kill him.\""
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm01_Quartero_6"		"Did it work?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm01_Quartero_7"		"(Laughing)"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm01_Quartero_8"		"It did not."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm02__title_0"		"Golden Armor"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm02_Quartero_0"		"Your eyes aren't deceiving you. Those glowing spikes on the shoulders? Oh yes. That's genuine Six-Hell crystallized brimstone."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm02_Quartero_1"		"Each spike lovingly hammered by hand."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm02_Quartero_2"		"...each hand lovingly attached to someone thrown screaming into a volcano, after every single spike."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm02_Quartero_3"		"Put your ear close and listen. You hear that? "
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm02_Quartero_4"		"That's right. Screams. Of pride, I imagine."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm02_Quartero_5"		"At any rate, my clever plan was to use deception to pit the genies against each other. "
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm02_Quartero_6"		"A real comedy of errors, like in those classic plays where a handsome rogue tricks two genies into killing each other, you know the ones."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm02_Quartero_7"		"Of course, in THOSE plays it only works because nobody ever stops to compare notes and clear up the misunderstanding, which unfortunately these genies did almost instantly."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm02_Quartero_8"		"Bazroth, the supervisor, and Griknok, his subordinate, hashed it all out before I was halfway to the door."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm02_Quartero_9"		"And if there's one thing genies hate more than humans summoning them, it's apparently LYING about it."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm02_Quartero_10"		"Because they started telling me they were going to do things to my skeleton that didn't seem possible if done in sequence. They were simply going to have to pick one."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm03__title_0"		"Golden Sigil"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm03_Quartero_0"		"Ah. Excellent eye, hero. I see you've zeroed in on the backpiece. That's the obsidian sigil of the Sixth Hell."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm03_Quartero_1"		"I'm not sure which one, though. Hold on, I've got a sigil handbook around here somewhere."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm03_Quartero_2"		"Let's see... here... ah. \"Nal Vorrth Oog-MUR-toh.\" Roughly translated, \"Throw all concerns into the wind.\""
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm03_Quartero_3"		"Well that's nice. Hold on, I didn't see the umlaut over the O. Roughly translated, \"Throw all humans into the volcano.\" Hm."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm03_Quartero_4"		"Let me wrap up that gripping prison tale. Where were we? Summoning spell, Griknok the murder-genie, dead jailer, SECOND summoning spell, Bazroth the supervisor, both of them about to kill me, me and my skin out of tricks."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm03_Quartero_5"		"All set? Here we go!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm03_Quartero_6"		"So there I was: out of tricks. Griknok stomped over to me and grabbed me by the throat. \"I'm going to enjoy this,\" he said."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm03_Quartero_7"		"And hero? I believed him. He looked like he was about to have the time of his life."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm03_Quartero_8"		"But then Bazroth said, \"Oh no, you don't. You know the rules.\" And Griknok grumbled and stepped aside, and then BAZROTH puts his hands around my throat."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm03_Quartero_9"		"And I thought, \"the rules\"?  THIS might be useful."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm04__title_0"		"Golden Warkilt"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm04_Quartero_0"		"Ahh. I see your gaze has fallen on the Golden Warkilt of Ugmörto."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm04_Quartero_1"		"Your eyes have fine taste, hero. Smelted in magma drawn from the Six-Hell caldera, and cooled in the blood of the poor souls who made the shoulder spikes."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm04_Quartero_2"		"See that belt sigil? That's not ornamentation, that's a containment rune."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm04_Quartero_3"		"Nothing evil, it just... well, you know. Keeps everything contained down there."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm04_Quartero_4"		"So. Why COULDN'T Griknok kill me?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm04_Quartero_5"		"A very good question, and I needed a way to subtly insert it into the conversation, so I asked: \"Hey, why can't Griknok kill me?\""
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm04_Quartero_6"		"Well, according to Bazroth, every genie is allowed to kill whoever summoned them. That's the rule."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm04_Quartero_7"		"And because I'd told Griknok that stupid smelly Dodrick had summoned him, Griknok got to kill stupid smelly Dodrick."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm04_Quartero_8"		"I'd summoned Bazroth, so Bazroth got to kill me. I guess that's why it was the first thing both of them asked."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm04_Quartero_9"		"So I said, actually: I lied."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm04_Quartero_10"		"I summoned Griknok. I'd done ALL the summoning so far. They'd killed stupid smelly Dodrick for nothing."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm04_Quartero_11"		"And the genies didn't say ANYTHING after that, for a long long time."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm04_Quartero_12"		"And then Griknok said \"Shit.\""
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm04_Quartero_13"		"And then Bazroth, after a while, he also said \"Shit.\""
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm05__title_0"		"Gilded Fang"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm05_Quartero_0"		"Presenting the Gilded Fang!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm05_Quartero_1"		"Forged in the black fires of the Six-Hell Caldera, where only the heaviest metals survive."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm05_Quartero_2"		"Hauled from the very throat of the vent, its edge cast and hardened in a cataclysm of molten stone and threaded with vein-gold from the mantle of the Sixth Hell."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm05_Quartero_3"		"And that's a lot of technical mumbo-jumbo, but the gist is this axe is cool as hell and it's yours for free."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm05_Quartero_4"		"I'll also throw in the thrilling conclusion to my prison tale. Both the genies seemed to think they were in a LOT of trouble, and they were begging me to sign some contract they'd written up on Dodrick's skin stating that Dodrick had summoned both of them."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm05_Quartero_5"		"I gave the contract a once-over. It didn't look like there were any clauses hidden away in the fine print, so I added some."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_seasonal_winter_2025_Dialogue_q02_set04_itm05_Quartero_6"		"After all, I'd come to Ultimyr looking for some gear to steal, and then these two idiots show up wearing Six-Hell caldera armor. The shoulder guards alone were worth more than the entire university."
