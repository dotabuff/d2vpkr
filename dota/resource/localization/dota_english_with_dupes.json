      "DOTA_Archronicus_MadMoon_Page1": "WHEN A WORLD was still a cooling blob, it captured an eerie companion—a glowing crystalline sphere that came to be known in lore as the Mad Moon. This small orb was full of violent radiance—a visual reminder of conflict in the heavens, bright enough to compete with the sun in daylight.",
      "DOTA_Archronicus_MadMoon_Page2": "But the Mad Moon was no inert rock. It was more truly a prison, in which two warring ancient intelligences had been captured and flung into exile aeons before, once the vast Primordials that underlay creation had tired of their endless strife. The punishment for these Ancients was to be locked together in one form, forever falling through infinity...and thus it went until our unfortunate world captured that wanderer. \\n \\nFor ages, primitive societies rose and fell beneath its weird glare; creatures of varying intelligence and sophistication gazed up in wonder and curiosity, to whatever extent their sentience allowed. Meanwhile, orbital stress and tidal forces allowed the Mad Moon's inhabitants to begin exploit what were at first the slightest of weaknesses, as they set to work prying open their prison. The cracks spread slowly, from the tiniest fractures, until at last there were millions of fissures, vast and aglow with weird energies.",
      "DOTA_Archronicus_MadMoon_Page3": "On one apocalyptic night, the moon finally shattered, torn apart from within. Most of the moonstuff was flung into space or consumed as it hit the atmosphere. A few rare fragments fell to earth, either as fused molten lumps or as jagged crystals. The shards lay where they had fallen, and gradually the land around them recovered. As the survivors of the prehistoric cataclysm recuperated, flourished and developed civilizations, the Mad Moon became less a memory than a dream, with the night of its destruction woven into their myths.",
      "DOTA_Archronicus_MadMoon_Page4": "The fallen shards of primal matter had fractured into their original composites: Radiant and Dire. In its pure form, each type of stone gave off a peculiar energy. For those who settled around the sites, they found themselves feeding on this unearthly power until they had not only harnessed the energy but made themselves dependent on it. They built shrines around the Ancients and revered them, ironically, as godlike entities that had fallen to earth.\r\nThe Ancients, both Radiant and Dire, provided many benefits: kinetic energy, mana, protection, even resurrection. But the emanations changed everything in their influence. Around the Radiant, the effects were bright and colorful, evoking lightness and charm. Around the Dire, a sinister radioactive glow, a visual seepage indicative of poison and decay. Neither force was neutral; they were both perfect complements and total contradictions that could never be at peace.\r\nAs each stone's cultural influence spread, it eventually came in conflict with the societies of its rival. Interference between the Ancients was cause for war, as the presence of one caused a corresponding fall-off in the energy of the other. Each stone could only be restored to full power with the destruction of its Foe-stone. And so the enthralled creatures rallied to protect their land by destroying the neighboring Ancient, and from far and wide the Heroes heard the call to battle and came to join, hardly realizing that in some sense both sides were the same.",

Either by disease, or sword, the stories varied, but always it was spoken of two dragons dark blue in color and very much dead. \\n  \\nI set out immediately from my father's hold and found their scaly bodies charred on the property of a grain farmer three day's travel along the ridge road.  One great, one small, the dragons lay where they died, surrounded by the footprints of a much larger beast whose marks on the soil were large enough for a full grown keen to lie down in; and so I did, imagining the impossible scale of the animal in whose track I lay.  A grand dragon true, like the stories of old, and like some say still live in the southerly wastes. \\n \\nThe tracks crossed the land for some distance and ended where the beast took flight at the edge of the field.  So not by blade or pathosis had these young dragons met their end, but from an attack by one of their own kind. \\n \\nWith the good faith of my father's name, and a promise of immediate removal, I was able to purchase the rotting corpse of the lesser of the two dead dragons.  The specimen being nowhere near to full grown, I was able to drag it behind my trusty zonkey for several hours to my father's lands.  Several days of disarticulation and boiling commenced, followed by a full night's inurement in wax, until, at last, the entire skeleton was laid out before me in the great hall, available for study.",

As did the curious architecture of the shoulder.  The bones themselves, though very strong, were much lighter than I had expected.  More like the bones of a bird than a creature of scales and teeth. \\n  \\nMost unexpected of all was the remnants of an old shield found in the beast's insides. But this one carried a most unusual form of gullet iron, and on it the mark of an ancient order seen only rarely in these parts today, a dragon crest, and the seal of the Scaled Knights of Uthorian.  Woe to the knight who carried it.",

Razor's static link proved annoying to Lone Druid, forcing him to resort to pulling and occasionally jungling. Attempts at killing the top trilane failed as the combination of Weaver's shukuchi, living armor and nightmare were enough to stop any aggression and even get some counter kills.

That plan succeeded, while Queen of Pain also managed to earn a lot of farm against Juggernaut in the middle. Once Bane and Queen of Pain reached level 6, they started to roam and gank Lifestealer and Lone Druid. From midgame and onwards, DD's goal was to extend teamfights as much as possible, with Razor and Weaver being very good at sustained damage, Bane and Treant being good at keeping people alive, and Queen of Pain being good at cleanup.

MeanWhile, Queen of Pain got a kill on doom when she hit level 6. Once Doom and Silencer reached level 6, it became nearly impossible for Dreamz to take any full 5 on 5 fight, as Global Silence and Doom proved very difficult to deal with for both Queen of Pain and Weaver.

The sheer burst power of Queen of Pain combined with Leshrac and Visage allowed Vici Gaming to gain control of the early game, and take their first Roshan at 17 minutes. Once in control, they chose not to rush, instead focusing on controlling the map and getting ahead in farm. After taking a second Roshan at 28 minutes, they waited for Rising Stars to make a mistake.

While other supports can pressure lanes, none can do so at a global scale, all the while maintaining steady experience and gold gain.

This game does an excellent job in showcasing Axe's strengths and weaknesses. Early on, Bulba's Axe was able to maraude through the map and find kills despite diving into 2 or 3 of Fnatic's heroes. However, due to Axe's weak scaling, as mid/late game rolled around, Axe's effectiveness fell off quickly. This is one of the few interesting case study of Axe, and it deserves a look for any Axe fans.",

Rox.kis started out the game strong by securing multiple outer towers and Roshan, and came knocking with a pre-20 minute rax push. Up against an insanely farmed Lycan and Nature's Prophet, itemless Shadow Fiend and Slardar were Sigma's cores. What came after this point was a series of the most amazing defenses I have ever witness as a Dota caster. Fata's Shadow Fiend was, as Draskyl pointed out, the embodiment of Power, utilizing one of the most creative Shadow Fiend item build ever. Though Fata is not the Dreamleague MVP during week 3, he's won me over in this game. A must watch.",

As far as me going full time, it just happened naturally - there was never a moment where I made a decision to go full time.",

      "Comp_1248_PG_redmoon4textcustom3_text": "Oroboros: I come in at the beginning, middle and end of the process typically. I typically try to come up with a tidbit of lore for each item before starting the concepting process. When a concept feels good, it typically goes to Bounch and we usually have a feedback phase where I get a chance to do paintovers of the model in its WIP state. When the model is completed, I typically collaborate with Andrew and Bounch to pose the set and get a Marmoset render for illustrations and other marketing materials.",
      "Comp_1248_PG_redmoon4textcustom4_text": "Bounch: Once Oroboros feels confident in his design of the current item, he then passes it off to me. I do slight revisions based on the triangle budget we have available to make it with then start off with the modeling. My primary programs for this phase are Maya and Zbrush, to block out and then detail the model respectively. Once I'm happy with how the high resolution sculpt looks, I take it into a program such as TopoGun or Maya to create the game resolution mesh.",
      "Comp_1248_PG_redmoon4textcustom5_text": "This can sometimes be difficult due to the polygon limitations imposed by the game engine, but with enough thought and some trickery we can make most things work without going too insane. After this mesh is made, I then paint it up using Photoshop and 3D Coat before rigging and previewing in the game. If it's a ward or courier, I will pass off the mesh before I start texturing so Andrew can begin his process of bringing it to life.",
      "Comp_1248_PG_redmoon4textcustom6_text": "Andrew: Covering just my end, the animation side of things. Once Bounch sends me a 3D model, I put bones inside it and create controls to influence those bones. Think of it like a virtual puppet, and I'm its puppeteer creating the illusion of life. But before I animate it, I make sure to find some reference, something from the real world I can use to base the animations off of to make them more relatable and grounded. After I finished the animations, I start testing everything in the game, making sure it works as intended. I get some final critiques from other artists, apply any feedback, polish everything up then finalize and ship it to the workshop.",

This might be a bit boring of an answer, but it usually consists of waking up, working, taking a small break for food, maybe playing a game of Dota or CS:GO, working, and then going back to sleep to repeat it all tomorrow. I must say it does feel a bit strange waking up right when the sun is going down sometimes, but right now it's all about getting cosmetics done so the players have cool stuff to use in game. I'm hoping to make more time in the future to pursue my traditional art and music interests but for now Dota has a firm grip on me.",
      "Comp_1248_PG_redmoon5textcustom4_text": "Oroboros: At the moment it's an absolute seesaw, but the average day so far starts late in the afternoon and goes till early morning. We've been working with so many international organizations that it's become necessary to stay up late to keep the communication channels open and our clients happy. I typically reserve a few hours to spend time with my family and get some exercise before heading over to the office to spend a day cranking out concepts.

      "Comp_1248_PG_redmoon5textcustom5_text": "Andrew: It's hard to define a day.

      "Comp_1248_PG_redmoon8textcustom4_text": "Oroboros: It's all about the community - we always submit our stuff to social channels to get feedback. I'm always gauging reactions on items we release, and apply the feedback in the hope of making our current or next creation better. Sometimes we have to take things with a grain of salt as it's easy to be swayed by a vocal few over the silent majority.",
      "Comp_1248_PG_redmoon8textcustom5_text": "Andrew: It's hard to judge. Most of the time, the feedback you receive will be one of two things, with a very small minority offering anything you can directly use.

      "Comp_1248_PG_redmoon9textcustom3_text": "Bounch: I get most of my ideas for lore from what's available on the Dota 2 main website, and an awesome thread on dev.dota2 that has breakdowns of every hero and their relationship with the world and other heroes. It's a great resource and I've learned a ton - it's honestly really fun to see how fleshed out the universe feels, at least considering my original expectations for a game like this. Unfortunately it seems Valve has decided to remove the lore snippets from the store, though I'm hoping it's only temporary.",
      "Comp_1248_PG_redmoon9textcustom4_text": "Oroboros: It's all about spinning off existing lore! I rarely deviate from Valve's lore, as there's plenty to go off. We always try to tie our submissions to locations and backstory provided by Valve and the community.",

As for a set someone else created, the Twin Blades set for Bounty Hunter by Motenai and Vidotto, which hasn't gone in yet unfortunately.

Learn as much as you can about the subject you decide to pursue and surround yourself with it.

Go to Polycount, surround yourself with like-minded creators and do your best. Don't give up after the first submission, expect a wait to get that first item in. It's kind of a tough, ever-evolving scene to break into, but I've learned that persistence pays off eventually.",

With Stonehall in ruins and its War Council scattered or dead, the guiding leash on the Legions had been severed. Soon other Legion Commanders would lay claim to territory, titles—even crowns—and start settling old scores.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br><br>But with the influx of Stonehall's survivors, and the handful of ex-legion amongst them, perhaps the Quathan Elders could truly reform the ancient Guard, a new generation of warriors to follow in the steps of three Initiates who had sacrificed the philosopher's path to defend their homeland.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br><br>As for Legion Commander Tresdin, that was the last Quath would see of her.

      "DOTA_CompendiumRecap_Story1Body": "In November 2015, sixteen of the world's best teams competed in the Frankfurt Major, the first Valve Major event held outside of The International, for a total prize pool of $3,000,000.  Eight teams received direct invites to the event—seven of the top eight teams from The International 2015, and Vega Squadron, who had just come from a convincing first place finish at ESL One New York in which they took down the daunting trio of EG, Secret, and IG.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother eight teams punched their tickets by advancing through the Regional Qualifiers, most notably team Monkey Business (later renamed to OG) securing first place in the European Qualifiers, and Team Unknown finishing second in the Americas Qualifier after surviving the Open qualifiers, where over 500 teams competed for a single spot.\r\n\r\nFrom the start of the group stage, The International 2015 Champions EG had little difficulty topping their group, with fan favorites Team Secret and Vici Gaming following suit. Less expected, Team Mineski from South East Asia scored a clutch victory over EHOME, earning them a second-place finish in their group and a seed in the upper bracket of the playoffs.\r\n\r\nOnce in the main event, the four favorites—EG, Secret, VG, and CDEC—advanced easily to the Upper Bracket Semifinals, where the two western teams would eventually eliminate their Chinese counterparts to set up a much-anticipated EG vs. Secret Upper Bracket Finals. Down in the lower bracket, EHOME and OG—two teams surprised to find themselves one series from elimination—soared through their matches until meeting each other in Round 5 of the lower bracket matches. Despite a very even match, OG managed to take the series 2-1. With that victory as a springboard, OG had all the confidence needed to best EG, who had lost their series against Secret, and project themselves into the Grand Finals, ultimately being crowned Frankfurt Major Champions after a convincing 3-1 victory over the mighty Team Secret.",
      "DOTA_CompendiumRecap_Story2Header": "After the Major",
      "DOTA_CompendiumRecap_Story2Body": "After The Frankfurt Major, the competition didn't stop. Just one week after the confetti fell, teams were competing at the LAN finals of Dreamleague Season 3, where OG showed their Frankfurt victory was no fluke, taking the top spot again by defeating a renovated Team Empire, who in turn would proceed to take first place at Dreamhack Moscow only weeks later.\r\n\r\nIn December, we saw the final competitive matches of the 6.85 patch, with Team Liquid quickly declaring themselves a team to watch by taking top honors in The Defense Season 5. Also not to be forgotten, TI5 champions Evil Geniuses took the gold in the always-entertaining fourth version of The Summit, finishing just below a solid Virtus.Pro squad.\r\n\r\nRinging in the new year was a new patch, bringing new winners and new losers along with it. Fans who enjoyed The International 2013 will be excited to hear that Alliance is back—not only back to the roster that won it all at Benaroya Hall, but also back to the winner's podium. After taking consecutive championships at World Cyber Arena and Starladder I-League, netting almost $500,000 in the process, Alliance is not a team to be ignored or forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe stage is set in Shanghai for an amazing tournament. Every team dreams of joining OG in the elite club of Major winners, but only one can make that dream a reality. That is, unless OG manage to prove the throne is theirs alone to occupy.",
      "DOTA_CompendiumRecap_Story3Header": "Gameplay Updates",
      "DOTA_CompendiumRecap_Story3Body": "The 6.85 patch was released on September 24, 2015, and shaped the meta for the following 83 days into a highly teamfight-oriented playstyle, favoring early-game carries and semi-carries as well as BKB-piercing teamfight heroes. The Frankfurt Major, played on this patch, featured Tusk (56.6%) and Winter Wyvern (49.5%) as the most-picked heroes, while Doom (72.7%) was by far the most-banned hero of the tournament. Keeping with the concept of strong teamfighting, the most successful heroes with more than 20 games in the tournament were Earthshaker (17-11) and Undying (18-12), with a special mention to Bounty Hunter, who won 9 of the 12 matches in which he was picked.\r\n\r\nPatch 6.86 arrived on December 16th, adding the new hero Arc Warden to public games, and adding Earth Spirit, Terrorblade, and Oracle to competitive play. With the introduction of new items like Aether Lens and Faerie Fire, multiple hero revamps, as well as new mechanics that make it more difficult for most heroes to flash-farm stacked camps, different heroes have come to the forefront of the meta game—Invoker and Gyrocopter being two heroes frequently picked or banned. The addition of two jungle camps revitalized jungling heroes, putting Chen and Enchantress as the respective #1 and #3 heroes with the highest win rate of those with over 50 games played.\r\n\r\nWith early pressure heroes like Zeus and Death Prophet making appearances, split-pushers like Nature's Prophet abundantly featuring in the most-picked category, and late game powerhouses like Spectre and Sven finding new life as some of the most successful heroes, it is fair to say the meta game has not yet settled, and we will surely find lots of surprising developments this March at the Shanghai Major.",
