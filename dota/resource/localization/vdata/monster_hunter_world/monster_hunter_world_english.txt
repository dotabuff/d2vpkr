Next to him are the bodies of a few creatures that appear to be made of wood. Or chopped wood after Frug got done with them.
<br/><br/>After I introduce myself, Frug explains he's hoping to become a hero. He says I can be the first to write of his exploits, starting with the aftermath of the battle he'd just fought and won.
<br/><br/>\"When yer lookin' to become a hero, these guys are a good way to get some practice in,\" the barbarian grunts. \"Even them proper heroes still whet their blades on 'em.
<br/><br/>\"An' here's the best part,\" he adds before leaning down and pilfering coins from the corpses he'd made.
<br/><br/>I point out that butchering victims and looting their bodies doesn't seem very heroic.  Frug scratches his chin and frowns.
<br/><br/>\"All heroes do it,\" he says, though he seems unconvinced of his own words. \"If all heroes do it, it can't be wrong. Can it?\"
<br/><br/>With that, he grunts again, snatches up his hefty axe, and tromps off into the forest."

<br/><br/>The barkeep warily tells Frug he's welcome to sit anywhere he likes. After the barbarian buys an ale and sits heavily at a small table, I decide to chance another meeting.

<br/><br/>He grins proudly and points to the masked skull he'd brought into the bar. Both the mask and the wound where Frug had beheaded the thing are gruesome sights.

A deadly force, they'd struck quickly, but Roshan had struck back harder. Only two of the Scarlet Five escaped the creature's pit, one wounded beyond repair. Roshan survived.

<br/><br/>Especially since Imperia had stolen the throne from Shendelzare in the first place, hacking her wings off in a palace coup and throwing her from the highest tower, where she was left for dead. Only a chance encounter with a wandering goddess of mischief saved her life. 
<br/><br/>Well, mostly. For years, she existed in a state that was neither entirely alive or dead. I'm assuming that's where the \"spirit\" part of her nickname comes in. I'm also guessing her evil sister taking her throne and almost murdering her is where the \"vengeance\" part crops up.

<br/><br/>Well, mostly alright. There's also the business of the Flightless, a caste of bird creatures who threw in with Shendelzare to help overthrow her sister, in exchange for equal treatment in the kingdom. It seems they're holding her to her bargain, and there have been growing pains.
<br/><br/>Still, she is confident she can bring peace, as long as she is just and fair — not her sister, in other words. She doesn't seem very interested in revenge these days. \"Vengeance may have won me a kingdom,\" she says, \"but it cannot win me its people.\""

It's said that his Advanced Thaumaturgical Cosmology class has had only five students pass in the entire 42 years he's taught it. It's not that he's a tough grader. It's more that Ultimyr doesn't like sharing the secrets of weaving the fabric of reality itself unless you can prove you're not going to get a word wrong in your spells.
<br/><br/>Thaddeus, it turns out, did his doctoral thesis on the Weavers, and his eyes light up in recognition when I ask. The Weavers, he explains, are custodians of existence itself. They aren't architects, and they aren't gods — to a Weaver, the universe is cloth stretched across a great loom. They mend rents where time wears thin; tighten sagging stitches; reinforce faded regions before something dark, unmentionable, and not from our plane of existence sneaks through. <br/><br/>
<br/><br/>It sounds like a thankless and repetitive job, and while Thaddeus is quick to paint Skitskurr as a villain, it's hard to deny any one of us might give in to the same temptation. Skitskurr was one of the best Weavers — but he grew restless with patching the same holes over and over for eternity. He grew bored of mere maintenance of reality. He longed to create one of his own.
<br/><br/>His experiments started small, but it didn't take long for the guardians to notice. He'd restitched too much of the pattern of the universe, and the threads led back to him. The guardians cut his world away, exiling him out of the overworld, and into the mistake of a world he may or may not have made: ours. 
<br/><br/>Thaddeus doesn't teach any classes on Skitskurr. The fewer who know his story, the safer the weave remains. \"Our reality might not be perfect,\" he says, \"but I tend to prefer it the way it is.\" "

<br/><br/>We're sitting in the rubble of an old inn in the Shadeshore Ruins, and while the Slithereen Guard are fearsome and brave, my source startles at every rustling noise.
<br/><br/>\"He's not like us,\" he shudders. \"We're powerful, but he's vicious. Vicious and cunning.\"
<br/><br/>For years, Slark's malice had been constrained. He'd been imprisoned in Dark Reef, an impregnable sunken prison where hope seeps in and nobody gets out. Nobody, that is, until Slark. He'd attempted a jailbreak once before and barely been stopped. He'd been imprisoned for half a lifetime before he got his next chance at a jailbreak, joining up with a dozen other inmates.
<br/><br/>\"I don't think he joined because they had a good plan,\" the guard said. \"He made his own plan and just used theirs as a distraction. He knew they were gonna fail.\" He thinks. \"He might have been the reason.\"
<br/><br/>\"I don't know what that vicious little gillsucker did to get put in here,\" he says. \"But if you're ever in jail and there's a jailbreak,\" he adds, \"he'd be the one I'd follow.\""

<br/><br/>A traveling theater company had come, bringing a pantomime about the mythical Gorgons. Like most pantomimes, it was silly, mocking. And the Gorgon Medusa does not take kindly to mockery.
<br/><br/>\"The show was booked for a week, then the performers were supposed to move on,\" said Luther Garrick, the town's new mayor. \"But I guess word had got out about their show, and how funny it was. It was pretty savage. People weren't used to telling jokes about Gorgons in public like that. Big hit.
<br/><br/>\"Anyway, Medusa showed up on day three.\"
<br/><br/>Ages ago, Medusa's own sisters had been kidnapped for their beauty and immortality. She herself had forsaken her own stunning appearance for the tools to exact revenge. She slithered into Sholcaste and cast her stone gaze on the actors. Then she turned on the crowd who had been laughing along with the show.
<br/><br/>The statues still decorate the town square, too heavy to move from the stage. They serve as a warning to hopeful thespians: Don't make fun of Gorgons if you can't handle the reviews."

<br/><br/>\"We can't stand that guy, and we're trolls—we put up with a lot,\" grunts one with a meaningful nod toward their camp's cook, who's spitting in the rancid stew he's boiling up for the tribe.
<br/><br/>The group takes turns listing off expletives to describe Jah'rakal before eventually getting to the crux of the matter.

<br/><br/>Jah'rakal didn't take kindly to his exile. He returned the next day, twirling his axes.
<br/><br/>\"Bastard killed my cousin dead,\" the troll says. \"Him and about 20 others. Just went feral on 'em.

Tonight is no different, with everyone buzzing about the big fight. But not tonight's big fight. It's one year later, and it still feels like the only fight worth talking about.
<br/><br/>The day Warrunner returned to Omexe. He had returned a conquering hero. 
<br/><br/>But there's no basking in past glory in the ring. And there's nothing a fresh, young, hungry combatant wants more than to conquer a conquering hero.
<br/><br/>For months, the bookmakers had tabbed a young upstart named Thalanax as the perpetual betting favorite. He hadn't disappointed to that point. And when Warrunner snorted and stamped his hoof at Thalanax's challenge, the youngster, more brawn than brains, failed to take it for the warning it was.
<br/><br/>Thalanax's funeral was sparsely attended. He'd lost a lot of people a lot of money in that fight.
<br/><br/>Warrunner said he would happily return to the Omexe any time to kill whoever wanted to challenge him for the belt. \"And I will likely take my time,\" he added, \"to make it worth the trip.\" So far, if anyone else thinks they have a shot at it, they've kept it to themselves. "

<br/><br/>His father, Kaelor Umbercloth, had been as esteemed as a poacher can be—which is to say not very, outside of poaching circles. Kaelor had set his sights on trapping one of the gargantuan beasts when Vaer was just a boy of 12. The creature's magnetic horn alone would have earned his father enough coin to feed his family for years.
<br/><br/>But when Mount Joerlak erupted, spewing liquid fire and ash for miles, the magnoceroi that didn't die in the disaster fled north. All except for one: Magnus. Kaelor didn't even have time to ready his spear before he was pulled by some unseen force toward the beast. Vaer watched from a hunting blind as Magnus' horn impaled him.
<br/><br/>\"A real prize,\" Vaer mumbles as he pulls a fox from a rusty trap. \"But they ain't worth the cost.\""

That told me two things: That I'd found Rizzrack, and that the rumors about his sanity were probably accurate. 
<br/><br/>As I approached, I began to hear the scream of metal on wood, the fresh air of the forest replaced with an oily scent. There in a clearing, laughing at the top of his lungs, was Rizzrack in his mechanical suit. 
<br/><br/>He looked preposterous. He also looked consumed by equal measures of hatred and madness. He wasn't cutting the pine so much as punch-slicing it with the rotating saw on his suit's arm. As the branches fell, Rizzrack shouted a stream of obscenities about the tree's parentage.
<br/><br/>Once he was done, I cleared my throat and he turned towards me. Rizzrack stared at me for a moment, a twisted smile on his lips, then whispered, \"Are you a tree?\" "

<br/><br/>We were sitting in a pub in Njord's Hearth (that was disgustingly filthy even by the standards of Njord's Hearth), not far from where the brawler Rigwarl — known to the locals as \"Bristleback\", \"that drunk\" and \"that angry drunk who won't stop fighting everybody\" — had met his first defeat. Mention of the fight drew a nervous side-eye from the bartender. The shady patrons within earshot popped their coats on and slipped outside.
<br/><br/>\"Sucker punchin' ain't right,\" Rigwarl growled before turning his head to spit a green glob onto the floor (repulsive even by the standards of green globs). It appeared the pub hadn't been cleaned in months. The spit somehow still made it worse.
<br/><br/>Of course, the bartender knew better than to ask Bristleback to leave — not when he was worked up like this. Shoddy plasterwork tried and failed to conceal gaping holes in walls from the last few times someone had tried to kick Rigwarl out. Luckily, the brawler made the decision himself. He pounded back the last of who knows how many ales and stood.
<br/><br/>\"Yeh, I'm gonna find that bastard right now, give 'im what for,\" he vowed before striding to the door, punching it off its hinges and skulking off into the chilly dusk.

<br/><br/>A small, sturdy young woman appears from behind a copse of trees to my left and adds an ominous whistle.
<br/><br/>\"I'm only here to speak with you,\" I offer, bowing deeply.

<br/><br/>\"Such gestures are reserved for Selemene,\" Mirana murmurs in reverence. These woods are Hers; I am but their keeper.\"
<br/><br/>I ask why she gave up a life as the next heir to the Solar Throne to serve another. She seems to find the question silly.
